TITLE:	Grappling Hook V. 1.12

AUTHOR:	M. Vinskus (Sid 6.7)
DATE:  	22-DEC-98

DESCRIPTION:
	Modified version of Grapv111

ABSTRACT:	
	Removed paralyzation property of the hook.  This makes the hook a legitimate 
tool/weapon now.  Otherwise, it might as well be an instant death gun.  

USAGE:
	1.  Create a directory under the quake directory called grapv112
	2.  Unzip the contents of grapv112.zip into that directory
	3.  Run quake with "quake -game grapv112"
	4.  The controls and parameters for the hook are the same as in grapv111


Happy hunting:
